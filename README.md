"A Wake-On-LAN script that is simple and easy to use eliminates the need to remember the MAC address of the single computer assigned to the script."

Run
wake = wake.py
sleep = remsleep.py

Notes:
remsleep.py returns errors related to the paramiko library.  I have tried to make the code ignore these but they persist.  The errors do not impact the functionality of the code.  It performs as expected.
